# Description

This repository contains the code of a university project based on the paper "**ASSERT: Anti-Spoofing with Squeeze-Excitation and Residual neTworks**"([ASSERT][ASSERT]).

The project involved the implementation of an anti-spoofing system based on a ***deep neural network*** (DNN). In particular, the **SEnet model (SEnet34, SEnet50)**, based on a **ResNet** architecture, was studied and integrated.

The system is structured as follows:
  - Download dataset
  - Feature engineering 
  - Model definition
  - Training
  - Evaluation of performance 
    
The file main.py contains the entire code.

During the work the code has been reproduced on Google Colab.
