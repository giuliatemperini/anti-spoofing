# anti-spoofing
This code reproduces the code of a university project based on the paper "**ASSERT: Anti-Spoofing with Squeeze-Excitation and Residual neTworks**"([ASSERT][ASSERT]).

The system is structured as follows:
  - Download dataset
  - Feature engineering 
  - Model definition
  - Training
  - Evaluation of performance 
    
The file main.py contains the entire code.

During the work the code has been reproduced on Google Colab.
